# Practical R 

Practical R, the blog, is built using Hugo, an open source static site generator available under the [Apache Licence 2.0.](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/LICENSE).  Hugo provides the ability to combine Markdown, R Markdown and HTML content files and uses shortcodes for adding rich content. This lets me focus on the content, not the blog.  

Websites built with Hugo are extremely fast, secure and can be deployed anywhere.

# D.J. Forbes  

I have a passion for data science and the transformative power of data visualization and design to simplify and elevate communication and to engage and inspire people everywhere.  

I first encountered R as a graduate student working on my Ph.D in 2011.  I was looking for a tool to do analysis of a spatio-temporal data set.  Commercial Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are not capable of doing that kind of analysis.  

I fell immediately in love with R and have come to think of it as an extension (and in some cases, an enhancement) to conventional GIS software for geospatial analysis.  I have never looked back, although I have looked back at my dissertation plots and other data visualizations and see that much improvement was possible back then, and also have far I have come to understanding R and improving my ability to do geospatial analysis with R.

I currently work as a geospatial analyst, demonstrating to my employer the benefits of geospatial data science.  I have a very strong background in computing in general, including five years as an DOS/VSE Assembler programmer on an ancient IBM 4341 mainframe where I reformatted address information and processed bulk mailing lists for a printing company.  I was able to bring this strong background into computing to Geography and the Geosciences (geology, geography).  

Along the way I put myself through four degrees (AA&S Science, BS Mathematics, MA Geography, PhD Geosciences) and basically am a poster child for "life long learner", going from being an IBM PC-DOS computer whiz to Windows (all flavors) and now the web.  Having decades of experience in computing, I firmly believe that technology should be focused as a benefit to people (and other living things).  There's much work to do for re-emphasizing the importance of the real world over the virtual.    

Extending my education from mathematics into geography and spatial data science has only increased the number of questions I hope to answer, so I expect to be doing this for many years to come.  I do this work because I love it and want to share what I've learned.  I guess this is my way of trying to make the web a better place.
