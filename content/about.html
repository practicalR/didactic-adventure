<h1>Practical R</h1>
<p>Practical R, the blog, is built using Hugo, an open source static site generator available under the <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/LICENSE">Apache Licence 2.0.</a>. Hugo provides the ability to combine Markdown, R Markdown and HTML content files and uses shortcodes for adding rich content. This lets me focus on the content, not the blog.</p>
<p>Websites built with Hugo are extremely fast, secure and can be deployed anywhere.</p>

<h1>D.J. Forbes</h1>
<p>I have a passion for data science and the transformative power of data visualization and design to simplify and elevate communication and to engage and inspire people everywhere.</p>
<p>I first encountered R as a graduate student working on my Ph.D in 2011. I was looking for a tool to do analysis of a spatio-temporal data set. Commercial Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are not capable of doing that kind of analysis.</p>
<p>I fell immediately in love with R and have come to think of it as an extension (and in some cases, an enhancement) to conventional GIS software for geospatial analysis. I have never looked back, although I have looked back at my dissertation plots and other data visualizations and see that much improvement was possible back then, and also have far I have come to understanding R and improving my ability to do geospatial analysis with R.</p>
<p>I currently work as a geospatial analyst, demonstrating to my employer the benefits of geospatial data science. I have a very strong background in computing in general, including five years as an DOS/VSE Assembler programmer on an ancient IBM 4341 mainframe where I reformatted address information and processed bulk mailing lists for a printing company. I was able to bring this strong background into computing to Geography and the Geosciences (geology, geography).</p>
<p>Along the way I put myself through four degrees (AA&amp;S Science, BS Mathematics, MA Geography, PhD Geosciences) and basically am a poster child for “life long learner”, going from being an IBM PC-DOS computer whiz to Windows (all flavors) and now the web. Having decades of experience in computing, I firmly believe that technology should be focused as a benefit to people (and other living things). There’s much work to do for re-emphasizing the importance of the real world over the virtual.</p>
<p>Extending my education from mathematics into geography and spatial data science has only increased the number of questions I hope to answer, so I expect to be doing this for many years to come. I do this work because I love it and want to share what I’ve learned. I guess this is my way of trying to make the web a better place.</p>
