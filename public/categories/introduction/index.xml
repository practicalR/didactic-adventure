      <description>IntroductionData VisualizationData ScienceIntroductionAre you struggling to learn R so you can create banging data visualizations and produce data science projects that add value?
You are not alone. Analyzing data is now common to a lot of professions that may not have any background in programming or computer science.
Are you full of excitement for your new R project but finding it difficult to quickly achieve the results you want and need?
Coming from a background in other programming languages may be problematic because R does some things a little bit differently.
Are you taking a course in R and finding that you can’t keep up with the class and need some background?
Or are you just interested in learning more about R and what R can do?
I would like to help you do more with R. I want to inspire you to create your own data visualizations, master data science, or develop your own data stories.</description>
