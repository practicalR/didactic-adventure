      <description>IntroductionData VisualizationFigure 1Data ScienceFigure 2IntroductionAre you struggling to learn R so you can create beautiful and effect data visualizations and produce data science projects that add value?
You are not alone. Analyzing data is now common to a lot of professions that may not have any background in programming or computer science.
Are you full of excitement for your new R project but finding it difficult to quickly achieve the results you want and need?
Coming from a background in other programming languages may be problematic because R does some things a little bit differently.
Are you taking a course in R and finding that you canâ€™t keep up with the class and need some background?
Or are you just interested in learning more about R and what R can do?</description>

      <description>Practical RD.J. ForbesPractical RPractical R, the blog, is built using Hugo, an open source static site generator available under the Apache Licence 2.0.. Hugo provides the ability to combine Markdown, R Markdown and HTML content files and uses shortcodes for adding rich content. This lets me focus on the content, not the blog.
Websites built with Hugo are extremely fast, secure and can be deployed anywhere.

D.J. ForbesI have a passion for data science and the transformative power of data visualization and design to simplify and elevate communication and to engage and inspire people everywhere.
I first encountered R as a graduate student working on my Ph.D in 2011. I was looking for a tool to do analysis of a spatio-temporal data set. Commercial Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are not capable of doing that kind of analysis.</description>

      <description>Practical R Practical R, the blog, is built using Hugo, an open source static site generator available under the Apache Licence 2.0. Hugo provides the ability to combine Markdown, R Markdown and HTML content files and use shortcodes for easily adding rich content. Websites built with Hugo are extremely fast, secure and can be deployed anywhere. Learn more or contribute on GitHub.
The content for the blog is created using the R blogdown package and RStudio. The blogdown package produces a static website, meaning the website only consists of static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images, so it&#39;s very easy to manage. It also allows for developing content in R Markdown, which allows for easily embedding and sharing code and code output, including tables and plots.
Combined, these let me focus on the content, not the mechanics of the blog. So I can focus on producing content that might be both engaging and useful.</description>
