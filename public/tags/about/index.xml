      <description>Practical RD.J. ForbesPractical RPractical R, the blog, is built using Hugo, an open source static site generator available under the Apache Licence 2.0.. Hugo provides the ability to combine Markdown, R Markdown and HTML content files and uses shortcodes for adding rich content. This lets me focus on the content, not the blog.
Websites built with Hugo are extremely fast, secure and can be deployed anywhere.

D.J. ForbesI have a passion for data science and the transformative power of data visualization and design to simplify and elevate communication and to engage and inspire people everywhere.
I first encountered R as a graduate student working on my Ph.D in 2011. I was looking for a tool to do analysis of a spatio-temporal data set. Commercial Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are not capable of doing that kind of analysis.</description>
